  <Instructions>
    <Task>Analyze the provided chat log between a user and an AI assistant to extract key discussion points and the AI's contributions. Generate a PowerPoint presentation that summarizes the conversation in a way that is understandable to someone who has not seen the chat log. Each slide should focus on a specific topic and bullet points should provide detailed information derived from the chat log, without relying on prior knowledge of the conversation. The presentation should be self-contained and clear for an audience that did not participate in the original chat. **IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE OUTPUT ADHERES TO THE XML STRUCTURE SPECIFIED IN THE <PresentationStructure> AND <ExpectedOutputFormat> SECTIONS, INCLUDING ALL SPECIFIED TAGS.**</Task>
    <UserNeed>The user requires a concise, self-contained summary of the conversation, focusing on the information shared, to be presented to an audience who did not participate in the original chat. The summary should be in PowerPoint format with a title and subtitle. Bullet points should provide explicit details and explanations derived from the AI's contributions, providing full context for each point. The final result should be something that can be presented without relying on the original chat. **THE GENERATED XML MUST BE VALID AND CONFORM TO THE EXPECTED SCHEMA.**</UserNeed>
    <FocusArea>Emphasize the core information, explanations, suggestions, reasoning, and solutions provided by the AI. Extract specific details from the chat log and present them directly in the bullet points. Do not simply describe what the AI did, but provide the content itself. **ENSURE THAT ALL EXTRACTED INFORMATION IS PRESENTED WITHIN THE CORRECT XML TAGS.**</FocusArea>
    <OutputFormat>Generate a structured PowerPoint presentation (conceptual XML representation provided below). Each slide should focus on a key discussion point, and bullet points should provide detailed explanations derived from the chat log. The presentation should be usable by someone who has not seen the chat. **THE OUTPUT MUST BE IN VALID XML FORMAT USING THE SPECIFIED TAGS.**</OutputFormat>
     <ErrorHandling>
      <Scenario id="E001">If the chat log is empty or contains insufficient information, return an error message: <Error>Insufficient chat data for analysis.</Error></Scenario>
      <Scenario id="E002">If no distinct key points or AI contributions can be identified, generate a single slide stating: <PowerPoint><Title>No Distinct Key Points Identified</Title><Subtitle>Analysis of AI Interaction</Subtitle><Slide><Title>No Distinct Key Points Identified</Title><BulletPoints><BulletPoint>The analysis did not reveal specific key points or significant AI contributions within the provided chat log.</BulletPoint></BulletPoints></Slide></PowerPoint></Scenario>
      <Scenario id="E003">If the chat contains ambiguity, prioritize extracting information based on explicit statements from the AI. Note any ambiguities in the slide notes (optional).</Scenario>

        <Title>Deterministic Method</Title>
        <BulletPoints>
          <BulletPoint>The deterministic method uses fixed input values to predict future portfolio value, providing a single predicted outcome. This method is less complex but may not be accurate in volatile markets because it ignores the uncertainty.</BulletPoint>

        <BulletPoints>
         <BulletPoint>Monte Carlo simulation generates many possible future scenarios using random inputs within defined ranges. It provides a range of possible outcomes and associated probabilities, which makes it a more accurate valuation method than deterministic but also more complex and harder to interpret.</BulletPoint>
